    content: [
      "Raised in St. Louis, I was homeschooled K-12 primarily by my mom who shaped my curious and independent spirit. While some picture homeschoolers as sheltered and awkward, my life flips that script. I believe I'm normal but far from average, thanks to the freedom homeschooling gave me to explore the world and its endless opportunities.",
      "As a kid, I racked up trophies in competitive sports and found my creative groove in theatre arts - performing summers at The Muny (the largest outdoor theater in the nation). That spark took me to NYC for college, after which I sang and danced across the globe, including a year on a cruise ship. I dipped into the music industry, sold a few songs, though the industry part lacks much to be desired.",
      "I nearly debuted on Broadway in a Tony-winning show but chose a different path, learning to pivot with grace and understanding that some doors are better kept closed.",
      "In LA, I shifted from acting to become an award-winning film writer, TV director, and executive producer of an animated series, earning a Comic-Con Hall H panel. Homeschooling's flexibility taught me how to navigate these global stages effortlessly.",
      "Now back in St. Louis, I run an in-home healthcare company, serving those in need while continuing to feed my creative heart as an author.",
      "Far from sheltered, I've traveled the world, created, and impacted lives, and I'm thrilled for where my normal…ish journey leads next.",
